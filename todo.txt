To do next:
* Flesh out browser.cfg, use for realtime:
    * Links to other (pweer) cameras for same time
    * Big actagram start and stop times configurable
    * Default brighten on/off setting
    * Thumbnail scale configurable
* showpic.js - mouse hover over temporarily flip to image.


Future features:
* Calculate separate motion fatigues for luma and chroma (to better ignore shadows and trees)
* glitch detection for more than one frame (ignore events that last more than 1 frame)
* Option to not save pre and post event images?
* Image save rate liminting (raise threshold when too many aquired)
